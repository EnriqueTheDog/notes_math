two lines are parallel if they have similar [[slope]] but **different** [[y-intercept]]

if they have similar slope and y-intercept, they are not parallel because they are the same line

in the [[point-slope form]], the line parallel to y = mx + b that contains the point (h, k) is given by
$$y=m(x-h)+k$$
