the point-slope form of a line equation is
$$y=m(x-h)+k$$
where *m* is the [[slope]] and *(h,k)* is a point where the line goes through

this means that we can use this form when we know the slope and the coordinates of a point on the line

it can be easily simplified into [[slope-intercept]] form, for example:
$$y=\frac{2}{3}(x-6)+5$$
is equivalent to
$$y=\frac{2}{3}x+1$$
