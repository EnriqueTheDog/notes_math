the standard form of a linear equation is:

$$Ax + By = C$$
where: 
- A, B and C are integers
- A and B are not both zero
- A is non-negative

## usage

the standard form can be used to find the x-intercept and [[y-intercept]] of a line. Specially if we divide both sides by C:

$$\frac{A}{C}x + \frac{B}{C}y = 1$$

by substituing y for 0 we can found x-intercepts.
by substituing x for 0 we can found y-intercepts.

Therefore, the x-intercept is
$$(\frac{C}{A},0)$$
and the y-intercept
$$(0,\frac{C}{B})$$
