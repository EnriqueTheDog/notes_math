In pairs of equations, if we can isolate one variable in one equation, then we can substitute this variable for its value in the other.

There are two general paths when using **substitution**:

- If we want to know the value of x, it's often quickest to use one equation to isolate y, then substitute for y in the other equation.

- If we want to know the value of x, but y isn't easily isolated, we can isolate x and then solve for y instead.
